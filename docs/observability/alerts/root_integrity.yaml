              The Firewood pipeline reported root snapshot I/O failures in the last 5 minutes.
              Investigate the backing snapshot store and Firewood recovery tooling before
              re-enabling state sync peers.

              The state-sync verifier rejected a manifest or chunk mid-stream. Inspect the
              snapshot publisher, verify chunk checksums, and rotate the manifest/signature
              pair before resuming clients.
