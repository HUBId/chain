# Branch Audit Report

This file is generated by `tools/branch_audit/audit.py` and is intended for operators.
Run the audit regularly to keep the numbers current.

## Category Definitions
- **SAFE_MERGED**: Branch is fully merged into the canonical branch (0 commits ahead).
- **TRIVIAL_MERGE_CANDIDATE**: Few commits ahead (<=5) and recent (within ~90 days).
- **STALE_UNMERGED**: Not merged and older than ~6 months.
- **ACTIVE_WORK**: Not merged and last commit within 60 days.
- **SYSTEM_INFRA**: Protected, long-lived branches such as main/dev/release/staging/infra.

Canonical branch: **main**

## How to Use This Report

1. Review the counts above to estimate clean-up scope.
2. Generate delete suggestions for merged branches: `tools/branch_audit/generate_delete_commands.py --report tools/branch_audit/report.json`.
3. Generate merge/PR suggestions for small branches: `tools/branch_audit/generate_trivial_merge_commands.py --report tools/branch_audit/report.json`.
4. List stale branches for manual inspection: `tools/branch_audit/list_stale_unmerged.py --report tools/branch_audit/report.json`.
5. Manually execute only the commands you agree with; nothing here auto-deletes or auto-merges branches.
