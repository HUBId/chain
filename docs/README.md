# Operator documentation

Welcome to the operator guidebook. Start with the runtime [modes overview](modes.md), then dive into
configuration specifics, checklists, and runbooks as needed:

- [Configuration guide](configuration.md)
- [Operator checklist](checklists/operator.md)
- [Runbook: startup](runbooks/startup.md)
- [Runbook: observability](runbooks/observability.md)
- [Runbook: upgrade](runbooks/upgrade.md)

For additional topics, explore the existing documentation tree (e.g. `docs/telemetry.md` and
`docs/validator_quickstart.md`).
