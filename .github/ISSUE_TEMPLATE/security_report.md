Thanks for taking the time to responsibly disclose a potential security issue.

:warning: **Do not disclose sensitive details in a public issue.** :warning:

Please email the maintainers at [security@avalabs.org](mailto:security@avalabs.org)
or use the GitHub Security Advisories private reporting workflow instead. This
issue template exists only to redirect you to the private channel so we can
coordinate triage and remediation without exposing users to unnecessary risk.

If you have already sent the report privately, feel free to close this issue.
