# Security Policy

The canonical security policy for this project lives at [`/SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, **do not open a public issue.**
Instead, email [`security@avalabs.org`](mailto:security@avalabs.org) or submit a
private report through the GitHub Security Advisories portal so the maintainers
can coordinate a fix prior to disclosure.
