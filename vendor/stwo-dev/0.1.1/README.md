# STWO 0.1.1 Vendor Snapshot

This directory contains the curated 0.1.1 snapshot used by Firewood's vendored
STWO integration. Staged sources live under `staging/`, with manifests and
refresh logs recorded alongside them for reproducibility.

## Snapshot Notes

- GitHub automation assets from upstream (`.github/actions/`,
  `.github/runners/`, and `.github/workflows/`) are now included so the vendor
  tree retains the same CI automation configuration as the original repository.
