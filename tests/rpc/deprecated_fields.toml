# Deprecated RPC fields that must remain in published schemas until either
# their removal_version ships or the expiry date is reached.
#
# Add a new entry using the following template:
# [[deprecated_fields]]
# schema = "rpc/<schema-file>.jsonschema"
# field = "outer.inner"                 # dotted path through nested properties
# removal_version = "0.0.14"           # workspace version that permits removal
# expires_on = "2025-01-15"            # YYYY-MM-DD
# rationale = "Why the field is being removed"
#
# Keep this allowlist in sync with the release notes so downstream clients can
# plan migrations ahead of any breaking removal. Expired entries should be
# removed or updated in the same PR that changes the schema.
