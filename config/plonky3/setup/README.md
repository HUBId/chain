# Plonky3 setup artifacts

The fixtures in this directory are deterministic encodings of the proving and
verifying keys required by the Plonky3 backend. They can be regenerated by
running the helper script from the repository root:

```
python3 scripts/generate_plonky3_artifacts.py config/plonky3/setup
```

The script derives unique base64-encoded blobs for each circuit so that unit and
integration tests can reproduce the same artifacts during continuous
integration.
